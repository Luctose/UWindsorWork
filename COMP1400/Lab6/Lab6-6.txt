Exercise 6: What will be the output of the following C programs?

A)
The output of A is:
Hi. This is case 0
Hi. This is case 1

case 2 is not selected because the i = 2; inside the switch
is unreachable as it is outside of a case and the
while loop exits before i = 2.

There will be 1 iteration in program A.

B)
The output of B is:
Hi. This is case 0
Hi. This is case 1

case 2 is not selected for the same reason as A)

There will be 2 iterations in program B.
