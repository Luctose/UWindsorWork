    <h2>
        b. What is the minimum internet speed (connection speed) you may consider as a web
        designer and why?
    </h2>
    <h3>
        You must consider all internet speeds including slower connections because fast internet speeds are
        not available in every country. You surely will get traffick from slower clients and people do not
        like waiting a long time to load web pages. It is best to make your website as fast as possible.

    <h2>
        c. Does it have accessibility features? give an example from the website. To check that you
        may right click on the main page, select view source or page source (depends on the
        browser), find alt attribute in &lt;img&gt; tag? is there any with actual text not only
        alt=""? 
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Yes it does have accessibility features. When you zoom into the website with ctrl + scroll it still
        keeps a good layout no matter the zoom. All of the &lt;img&gt; tags have alts with text like this one
        &lt;img src="https://www.riotgames.com/darkroom/500/5a91edd0bf192c69f35af1d49714cc71:d31ffb16ad819dcf2a6876085ac91ab0/lol-seasonstart2022-logo.png" alt="Gameplay in Season 2022"/&gt;.
        They even have an accessibility page linked in the website footer. This is for suggestions for improved accessibility
        for people who had a harder time navigating the website.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        d. Which kind of viewing pattern does it have?
    </h2>
    <h3>
        It has an F-based viewing pattern because you read it left to right, then you scroll down for more content and repeat until
        the end.
    </h3>
    <h2>
        e. Does it have active white space or passive white space/ both/ none of them? example
        with screenshot is required.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Yes it does have active and passive white space. On this particular website the "white space" is actually black
        because the website has a dark theme.<br>
