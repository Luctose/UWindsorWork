Question 4:

For the insertion sort and n^2 graphs, You can see that they are not exactly lines up. I beleive this is because
n^2 is insertion sorts worst case. Most of the time insertion sort will be a bit less. It's worst case is when the order
of the array is greatest to least, and it's best case is when it is already sorted.

For the merge sort and the nlogn graphs, you can see they are overlapping. This is probably because mergesorts
worst case is its average case.

You can see that merge sort O(nlogn) makes a huge difference over insertion sorts O(n^2) on huge sizes of N.
(In this case up to 10000). Near the right side of the graph the comparison difference looks to be 100 more
for insertion sort.
