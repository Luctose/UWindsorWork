4. Compare static vs. dynamic linking of library routines.

Static linking links the extra opcodes to your programs before the program
starts executing. This will require a little more memory to process, but it
will run faster as it's always in memory. Dynamic linking is called for during
a programs execution time and will need to locate the nesseccary proccess via 
system call. The operating system will grab it for the program and because of
this it is a little slower, but uses less memory.

5. By example, compare closed programs, free programs, and open programs.

Closed programs are programs that you need to pay for to use and the source
code is not viewable and you only have access to the opcode. An example would
be the Windows 10 operating system. Free software is software that you did not
pay money for. An example would be League of Legends because it is a computer 
game that you don't have to pay money for. Open source software is software
that is not only free to use, but free to modify as you have the source
code. So you can add your own features or improve it and sell it yourself.
An example of this would be GIMP which is a raster graphics editor.
