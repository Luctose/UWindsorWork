3. UNIX did not initially recognize the mouse as an input device (still existing commercial versions have a
problem with it.) At what level of programming and in what programming language do we need to write
code to expand UNIX to support mouse inputs? Justify your answer.

Answer:

We need use system-level programming in order to support a mouse input. This is because we have to add to the
device manager to be able to handle a mouse input. The device manager is part of the kernel and to modify the
kernel is what a system-level programmer does. Also you would need to add to the interrupt request handler and
the table that gives the proper handler address. So, you would need to use a lower-level language to save the
cpu registers after it is finished with the request.

4. Explain the trip that a mouse click takes to the UNIX kernel.

Asnwer:

First when you click the mouse button two circuits attach to each other sending an electric signal.
The processor suddenly recieves this electric signal and gets an interrupt request.
A lookup table mapping for all interrupt request will now be referenced based on the shock given by the mouse.
The one for the mouse click will be used and in return the instruction pointer will receive the address
to the location of the interrupt request handler for the mouse which is inside the kernel. Now the handler inside
the kernel can execute the mouse click.
