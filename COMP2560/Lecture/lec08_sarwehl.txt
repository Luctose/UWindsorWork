3. Like dynamic allocation of memory locations, is it able to deallocate the allocated memory locations at
runtime? Justify your answer.

Yes it is able to deallocate dynamically allocated memory at runtime using free(void *ptr), which will
free the memory pointed to by ptr. The dynamic memory should always be freed after allocated.

8. There is an error called `stack overflowâ€™. What are the causes of this error in a program/process?

Stack overflow is caused when too many new function calls storing too much data have been pushed onto the stack.
The stack section of the memory has reached the bss section and can no longer store more memory.
