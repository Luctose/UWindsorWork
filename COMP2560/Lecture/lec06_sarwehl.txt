1. Devices are categorized into two main groups: character devices and block devices. Explain the
differences and the effects on the way we should read or write to them.

Character devices read in single characters for input and output and are used more
for communication. Block devices have larger blocks of data that can be read or write.
An example of a character device is a trackpad, and an example of a block device is
a SSD.

7. When using read() or write() system calls, we need to specify a buffer. Should we select large buffer
or small? What is the optimum size of buffer based on the underlying task?

We should use a large buffer so that the input can be read properly because if we don't have
enough space in the buffer to store what we read or write then a problem will occur. The system
call will only return the used space in the buffer anyway. The optimum size of a buffer if we
know how much space we need and what type we can use sizeof(datatype) * amountneeded.
