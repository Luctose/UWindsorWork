Question 1:

Is cc, the C compiler, a built-in command of a shell of a UNIX-based/like operating system? Justify your
answer.

When you use cc you do not use it with ./ , but it is not a built-in command.
It is a program file where the opcode of it is stored in /usr/bin, the reason
the shell knows where cc is is because /usr/bin is part of the $PATH environment
variable which is the variable that stores the directories that the shell looks
in for files that execute if what you have typed in the command prompt is not a
built-in and not in the current directory using ./

Question 2:

How can we distinguish between shellâ€™s built-ins (commands) and a program which requests the shell
to be bootstrapped?

When the shell command line recieves an input it first checks if the input is a built-in command, then
it checks if there is ./ for a program file inside the current directory, then it looks for program files
inside the $PATH environment variable. So, the shell will check for it's built-in commands first and if it
is not one then it looks for program files. If there is ./ infront then it is always a program file.
