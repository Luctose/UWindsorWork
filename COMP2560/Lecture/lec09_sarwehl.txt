6. Which one is more dangerous, orphans or zombies? Why?

Zombies are more dangerous than orphans because when a child becomes an orphan,
it is adopted by the kernel as a foster father. But, when a child becomes
a zombie, it now has to wait until the parent goes to sleep in order for the
kernel to wake it up and give the exit code. If the parent never calls
wait(), then the zombie will stay in memory forever and won't be adopted
because the kernel knows there was already an existing parent.

10. How can a process have a grandchild? Explain by an example.

A process can have a grandchild if when the parent creates a child and
then the child creates a child process of it's own. The child of the child
is the grandchild of the original parent. The child will have the PID of the
grandchild and the granchild getpid() will be 0.
