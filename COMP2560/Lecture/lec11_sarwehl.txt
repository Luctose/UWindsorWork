2.a. Is it possible to transfer the variable a of type point from the child to the parent (or vice versa) in
IPC? Justify your answer.

Yes it is possible to transfer the variable a from the child to the parent when you just give the memory
address. It is giving information between processes on the same computer and has the same memory.

b. Is it possible to transfer the variable a of type point from a sender process to a receiver process
(or vice versa) in Network IPC? Justify your answer.

It is still possible but, you cannot use the memory address as it is a different computer and does not 
have the same memory. You can serialize the entire struct a and send all the data from that over, then
the receiver can deserialize it when it gets the bytes.

5. On the one hand, it is said that binding address for the sender/client process is optional. On the other
hand, it is said that any communication in a computer network requires the addresses on both sides
of the communication. Are these two sentences contradictory? Explain your answer.

These two sentences are not contradictory because the sender process will create a new socket with the
help of the network manager from the kernel. Because the process and the kernel are in the same
computer, they will have the same address. So, when you don't specify the sender address the kernel
will do it for you. However, the receiver address must be specified because the kernel is not in that
machine.
