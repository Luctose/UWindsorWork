The program in step 3 does not work because the parent process has a different memory
than the child processes it creates. So when the children set the different indicies
of the matrix to the multiplied values, it does it only for the memory of the child
and not the memory of the parent. To fix this you can either use a seperate file
to the store the calculations and then retrieve it with the parent, use shared memory,
or use a pipe.
