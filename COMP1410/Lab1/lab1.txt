Iterative Approach
Initialize a variable to count the sum.
Check for negative inputs and inputs with more than 8 digits.
Iterate until n is 0 and for each iteration add the last digit of
the number to sum and then remove the last digit of the number.
Return the sum after the iteration is finished.

Recursive Approach
Check for negative inputs and inputs with more than 8 digits.
Check for the base case - if there is only one digit left then
return that digit.
Else use the recursive step which returns the function call
of its own function with the current number without the last
digit as a paremeter. Then, add the last digit aswell.
