Part 4

Note: I use "" around single character variables to not confuse
them for actual english words.

order(a, b) explaination:
Order returns a bool value and accepts two pointers
that point to a and b.
First we define temp which is used to store temporary data
in which the original container is modified.
We check to see if the "a" value pointed to by the pointer is
greater than the value from the "b" pointer because we want "a" to
be smaller.
If true we will store "a" to temp and then change "a" to "b"
and "b" to temp.
return true when there is a swap.
return false when there is no swap.

swap_pointers(a, b) explaination:
swap_pointers has no return and passes in an address for a
pointer.
First it defines a temp variable that stores temporary pointers.
Using the adressess of the variables that store the pointers
to the original values, temp is set to "a", "a" is set to "b",
and "b" is set to temp.
